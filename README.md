# Hi, I’m Shubhang 👋

I’m a software engineer focused on **Linux kernel development**, **performance engineering**, and **scalable systems**. I enjoy working close to the hardware and building software that behaves well under real workloads.

I currently work at **Ampere Computing** on kernel scalability and performance for **AI inference** and **energy-efficient HPC platforms**. Previously, I worked at **Arm** on embedded systems, virtualization, and BSP development.
